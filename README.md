# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solutions! This repository contains my solutions for the daily coding challenges released during Advent of Code 2024.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
You can read more about it on the official website: https://adventofcode.com/2024

## Repository Details

- This repository contains my solutions to the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges.
- I am starting **10 days late**, so the first 10 days of challenges will be covered randomly.
- Solutions are written in **Java**.

## Structure

Each day's solution is located in a separate file/folder. The general structure is as follows:

```
adventofcode.day/
â”œâ”€â”€ one/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AoCDayOne.java
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dayOne.md
â”œâ”€â”€ two/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AoCDayTwo.java
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dayTwo.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ twentyfive/
    â””â”€â”€ AoCDayTwentyFive.java
```

- Each day's folder contains:
    - The Java solution (`AoCDayXXX.java`)
    - The input and problem explanation readme for that day (`dayXXX.md`), if available or required
